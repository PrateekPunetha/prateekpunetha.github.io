So, Nowdays I am using Android 10 on my device and I am enjoying it, but whenever I see those stock icons It kind of looks ugly to me. Sadly as of now there is no custom launcher which supports Android 10 with custom icon packs support. So I figured out one mod called Pixel Launcher Mods ( the name is pixel launcher mods but it works in quickstep and other launchers too ) and actually this mod helped me to change the icons and make my experience better by replacing those stock icons with my one of the favoriate icon pack i.e Alexis.

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/stockicons.png" alt="Stock Icons">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/girl.png" alt="Custom Icons">
    </div>
</div>

###### How to Use Pixel Launcher Mods


So Using Pixel launcher mods is pretty simple, First you need to download it  [From Here](https://labs.xda-developers.com/store/app/com.kieronquinn.app.pixellaunchermods){:target="_blank"}. Now just Open it and select your launcher (quickstep), after selecting the launcher You just need to click on apply icon pack and select your desired icon pack. 


<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/pmod.png" alt="Pixel Launcher Mods">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/apply.png" alt="Apply Menu">
    </div>
</div>


And we finally applied custom icon pack to the default quickstep launcher without any problems, but if we would have used any other launcher then we could not use the new gesture because as of now only quickstep supports it.
