Its been like 3-4 months I was using nitrogen os pie as my daily driver ROM and also maintaining it for my device, and suddenly when the Android 10 released I got excited for trying it to be honest. So I was searching at github for taking refrence from other device trees so that I could compile Nos 10 for my device, and actually I found many important things and I finally compiled nos for my device, by the way you can check my [github](https://github.com/PrateekPunetha){:target="_blank"}  for all the sources. <br>
I would like to thank Max (xyyx), wight554 (Volodymyr Zhdanov), Rahul, AmulyaX (Amulya Bhardwaj),  blacksuan19 (Abubakar Yagoub) and Mal  for helping me since the starting of the project from the pie times ( all are my good fams btw ).
