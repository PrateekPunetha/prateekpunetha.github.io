Today two months are completed since I am using nos and also maintaining it for my device  xD and during these months I got to learn so many things related to linux, git, etc. <br>
I would like to thanks AmulyaX, blacksuan19, Max ( Nos creator by the way he helps me many times ) and Rahul ( All are my fams ) for helping me regarding this project. <br>

###### Customizations:

Nitrogen OS have many customization options btw, Here are some main things :

> Status Bar Customization <br>
> Navigation Bar Customization <br>
> Lockscreen Customization <br>
> Power Menu Customization <br>
> Notification Customization...and Much More <br>

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/home.jpg" alt="Homescreen">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/qs.jpg" alt="Qs Tiles">
    </div>
</div>
 
These are some screenshots of nos, the theme is material ocean by the way which is nowdays my personal favourite, It was suggested to me by ma nibba  blacksuan19 , and the icon pack is Alexis which is also my personal favourite.

###### Battery life:

I have tried like many roms for my device i.e Xiaomi Redmi 5 Plus (Vince), But I got the most amazing and  lit  Screen On time in Nitrogen OS. 

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/bat1.jpg" alt="Battery Stats">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/bat2.jpg" alt="Battery Stats">
    </div>
</div>
 
As you can see the solid af battery stats which I got from nos, the Kernel which I am using is Dark Ages, this is also by blacksuan19, I always build nos with this kernel. <br>
