Nowdays I am using Material Ocean theme like literally everywhere for every apps and I have became a huge fan of material ocean theme
Here are some pictures and info about it.

###### Homescreen:

So lets start with the materialized homescreen

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/newhome.png" alt="Homescreen">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/newqs.png" alt="Qs Tile">
    </div>
</div>
 
This is the homescreen and as you can see how much pretty it looks with the theme.

###### Apps:

Oh yeah Material Ocean looks Classic 

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/spotify.png" alt="Spotify">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/cold.png" alt="Neffex Cold">
    </div>
</div>
 
Materialized Spotify  .. By the way I have been listening to neffex from months and really they are good  .. My favoriate is Cold by the way as you can see still I am listening to that song ðŸ˜ƒ

<div class="row 200%">
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/tg.png" alt="Telegram">
    </div>
    <div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
    <img src="/assets/images/netflix.png" alt="Netflix">
    </div>
</div>

###### How Do I Get This Theme ?

Just install swift installer from <a target="_blank" href= "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brit.swiftinstaller">Play Store</a>  and set the background to 0f111a and for accent whichever color you want, by the way I am using cyan nowdays i.e 80cbc4 <br>
After that just confirm your changes and install the overlays && Enjoy!
